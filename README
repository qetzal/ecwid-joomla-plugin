Someday / Maybe TODO list:
- Fix/rewrite the installer to avoid warning caused by "install xml file not found" error of installer module
- SSO
- Calculating min/max prices for google rich snippets considering options, options combinations, wholesale pricing
- Breadcrumbs for google snippets, integrate site path or just Home > Ecwid > Category > Product. Might be a bit tricky to get full category path without sending multiple requests to ecwid server
- Additional data for ajax-indexed product page. It displays only the basic data thus google will not be aware of the product options
